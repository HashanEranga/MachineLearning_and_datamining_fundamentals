    "\n",
    "### Mean Squared Error (MSE)\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Sensitive to outliers as it squares the errors.\n",
    "- Provides a clear idea of the magnitude of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Not intuitive because it is not on the same scale as the target variable.\n",
    "- Can be misleading if the data has many outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.\n",
    "- More interpretable because it is in the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Does not penalize large errors heavily, which might not always be desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Provides a measure of the average magnitude of the errors without squaring.\n",
    "- Interpretable and in the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Sensitive to outliers, similar to MSE.\n",
    "- Can be high even with small errors if they are large enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### R-Squared (R²)\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Provides an indication of how well future samples are likely to be predicted by the model.\n",
    "- Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Can be misleading due to the addition of predictors, which can always increase R² regardless of their relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjusted R-Squared\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Provides a more honest and reliable measure of the model's fit by adjusting for the number of predictors in the model.\n",
    "- Penalizes adding irrelevant variables, thus providing a better indication of the model’s true explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Can be less intuitive compared to R².\n",
    "- May not increase as well with additional variables.\n",
